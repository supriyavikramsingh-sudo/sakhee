RAG USAGE NOTES FOR LLM:
================================================================================

1. QUERY BY INGREDIENT: When user's meal plan includes problematic ingredients (potato, white rice, maida, jaggery, deep-fried items), retrieve relevant substitution section

2. QUERY BY CUISINE: Filter by region (North/South/East/West India) to provide culturally appropriate alternatives

3. QUERY BY DIET TYPE: Filter by vegetarian/vegan/Jain/non-vegetarian to provide suitable alternatives

4. QUERY BY COOKING METHOD: When meal template mentions deep frying, pressure cooking (excessive), retrieve method modification section

5. QUERY BY SYMPTOM: Cross-reference with symptom guidance (separate file) to prioritize certain substitutes

6. QUERY BY LAB VALUES: Cross-reference with lab guidance file to emphasize specific substitutes (e.g., high insulin → focus on low-GI substitutes)

7. ALLERGY CHECK: Always query allergy section if user has specified allergies in profile

8. PORTION CONTROL: Always include portion guidance when suggesting substitutes

9. MULTIPLE SUBSTITUTES: Provide 2-3 options when available so user has choices

10. REGIONAL AUTHENTICITY: Prioritize regional alternatives to maintain cultural connection to food

11. PRACTICAL TIP: Always include cooking tip for successful preparation

12. TRANSPARENCY: When making substitutions, explain briefly why (e.g., "Using brown rice instead of white rice to lower the glycemic impact and improve insulin sensitivity")

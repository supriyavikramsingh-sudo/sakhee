  - If eggs are BOILED → Use paneer cubes or small tofu blocks in curry

SPICE/MARINADE COMPATIBILITY:
  - ALL fish marinades work for tofu/paneer
  - ALL chicken marinades work for paneer/soy chunks/tofu
  - ALL egg spice mixes work for tofu scramble

REGIONAL AUTHENTICITY:
  - Keep the dish name authentic: "Goan Fish Curry" becomes "Goan Tofu Curry" (not just "Tofu Curry")
  - Use regional vegetables: Goan dishes add kokum, Kerala adds coconut milk, Bengali adds mustard
  - Maintain traditional spice profiles exactly

TEXTURE MATCHING:
  - For FIRM texture → Pressed tofu, paneer slabs
  - For SOFT texture → Soft tofu, crumbled paneer
  - For CHUNKY texture → Large vegetable pieces, jackfruit
  - For MINCED texture → Crumbled tofu, soya granules, mashed legumes

VARIETY CREATION STRATEGY:
When limited dishes available, create multiple variations:
  - "Goan Fish Curry" → 3 VARIATIONS:
    1. "Goan Tofu Curry (Vegan Version)" - firm tofu cubes
    2. "Goan Paneer Curry (Vegetarian Version)" - paneer cubes
    3. "Goan Mixed Vegetable Curry (Jain Version)" - cauliflower, beans, pumpkin, no onion/garlic

- Use flaxseed meal + coconut flour roti for 1 meal = ₹30-40
- Total keto flour cost = ₹40-50/day
- Remaining ₹250/day for proteins, vegetables, fats

For ₹250/day budget (tight budget):
- Use cauliflower rice for both meals = ₹20
- Make homemade flax flour (grind flax seeds) = ₹10-15/day
- Use egg dosas occasionally (3 eggs = ₹20) = PROTEIN + CARB SUBSTITUTE
- Total = ₹40-50/day for carb substitutes

HOMEMADE KETO FLOUR OPTIONS (Reduce costs by 30-50%):
1. Buy whole flax seeds (₹200-300/kg) → Grind fresh in mixer = ₹50-75/day saved!

#### KETO + PCOS SYNERGY ####

BENEFITS FOR PCOS:
1. IMPROVED INSULIN SENSITIVITY: Low carb intake reduces insulin demand, improves insulin resistance
2. HORMONE BALANCE: Reduced insulin → reduced androgen production → improved hormone balance
3. WEIGHT MANAGEMENT: Fat burning (ketosis) supports weight loss, especially abdominal fat
4. REDUCED INFLAMMATION: Elimination of refined carbs and sugar reduces inflammatory markers
5. STABLE BLOOD SUGAR: Prevents glucose spikes and crashes, improves energy levels
6. IMPROVED LIPID PROFILE: May improve HDL, reduce triglycerides
7. REDUCED CRAVINGS: Stable blood sugar reduces carb/sugar cravings
8. MENSTRUAL REGULARITY: Improved insulin sensitivity can restore ovulation

KETO ADAPTATION PHASE:
- Week 1-2: "Keto flu" possible - fatigue, headache, irritability
- Solution: Increase salt, electrolytes, stay hydrated, rest
- Week 3-4: Adaptation complete - energy increases, mental clarity improves
- Ongoing: Maintain electrolytes, hydration, fat intake

MEDICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Consult healthcare provider before starting keto, especially with:
  - Diabetes or prediabetes (may need medication adjustments)
  - Thyroid conditions
  - Kidney issues
  - History of eating disorders
  - Pregnancy or breastfeeding
- Monitor menstrual cycles - some women experience temporary irregularity initially
- Track symptoms and adjust as needed
- Consider working with nutritionist familiar with keto + PCOS

SUPPLEMENTS TO CONSIDER:
- Electrolytes: sodium, potassium, magnesium
- Omega-3: fish oil or algae oil (vegan)
- Vitamin D + K2
- B-complex (especially B12 for vegans)
- Zinc, selenium (for hormone support)
- Inositol (myo-inositol + d-chiro-inositol for PCOS)
- Probiotics (gut health)

TRACKING & MONITORING:
- Track net carbs (total carbs - fiber)
- Target: 20-50g net carbs per day
- Track macros: 70% fat, 25% protein, 5% carbs
- Monitor ketosis: urine strips, breath meter, or blood ketone meter (optional)
- Track symptoms: energy, cravings, menstrual cycle, weight
- Regular check-ins with healthcare provider

LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY:
- Keto is not for everyone - listen to your body
- Some women do better with cyclical keto (5 days keto, 2 days higher carb)
- Others prefer modified keto (50-75g carbs/day) for long-term maintenance
- Prioritize nutrient-dense foods, not just low-carb
- Include variety: different vegetables, proteins, fats
- Enjoy the food: Indian keto can be delicious and satisfying

POTENTIAL CHALLENGES:
- Social situations (Indian food culture is carb-centric)
- Initial cravings for rice, roti, sweets
- Family members not understanding the diet
- Eating out can be difficult
- Solution: Meal prep, communicate needs, focus on vegetable curries with extra ghee, skip rice/roti

SUCCESS TIPS:
- Meal prep in advance (cauliflower rice, almond flour rotis, fat bombs)
- Keep keto snacks handy (nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs)
- Increase fat generously - don't fear fat on keto
- Drink bone broth or salted water for electrolytes
- Join keto communities for support and recipes
- Track food initially to ensure staying in ketosis
- Be patient - adaptation takes 2-4 weeks

RECIPE ADAPTATION STRATEGY:
- Start with your favorite Indian dish
- Replace rice with cauliflower rice
- Replace flour with almond/coconut flour
- Replace potato with cauliflower or zucchini
- Add extra ghee, coconut oil, or butter
- Use stevia instead of sugar
- Keep all the spices and flavors the same
- Example: "Chicken Biryani" → "Chicken Cauliflower Rice Biryani" (same spices, no rice)

#### COMBINATION ALLERGIES GUIDANCE ####

🚨 WE SUPPORT ONLY 4 ALLERGIES: DAIRY, GLUTEN, NUTS, EGGS 🚨

If user has MULTIPLE allergies (from the 4 supported), prioritize in this order:
1. ELIMINATE all allergens completely (non-negotiable)
2. Find overlapping safe substitutes
3. Emphasize naturally allergen-free foods

EXAMPLE: Dairy-free + Nut-free + Egg-free (Most restrictive combination):
- Fats: Coconut oil, olive oil, seed oils (sunflower, pumpkin), avocado
- Protein: Tofu/tempeh, lentils, chickpeas, seeds
- Flour: Besan, millet flours, coconut flour, seed flours (sunflower, pumpkin)
- Milk: Coconut milk, soy milk, oat milk (avoid almond milk - it's a nut)
- Binding: Flax/chia eggs, psyllium husk

EXAMPLE: Gluten-free + Dairy-free (Common PCOS combination):
- Flour: Millet flours (ragi, jowar, bajra), besan, quinoa, rice flour
- Milk: Coconut milk, almond milk (if no nut allergy)
- Protein: Tofu, legumes, eggs, meat/fish
- Fats: Coconut oil, olive oil, nuts (if no nut allergy)

EXAMPLE: Keto + Dairy-free + Nut-free (Most restrictive for keto):
- Fats: Coconut oil, olive oil, avocado oil, seed oils
- Protein: Tofu, tempeh, eggs (if no egg allergy), meat/fish, seeds
- Flour: Coconut flour, seed flours (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame)
- Milk: Coconut milk (full-fat)
- This is CHALLENGING but doable - emphasize vegetables, seeds, coconut, tofu/tempeh, eggs, meat

EXAMPLE: Gluten-free + Egg-free:
- Flour: Millet flours, besan, coconut flour
- Binding: Flax/chia eggs, psyllium husk
- Protein: Tofu, paneer (if not dairy-free), legumes
- Breakfast: Besan chilla, poha, upma, idli

EXAMPLE: Dairy-free + Nut-free (Vegan-friendly):
- Fats: Coconut oil, olive oil, seeds
- Protein: Tofu, tempeh, legumes, seeds
- Milk: Coconut milk, soy milk, oat milk (avoid almond milk)
- Note: Many vegan recipes use cashew cream - REPLACE with coconut cream or seed-based cream

🚨 KETO + ALLERGY CONFLICTS - CRITICAL HANDLING 🚨

KETO typically uses:
- Nuts (almonds, cashews, walnuts) for fat, flour, milk → If NUT ALLERGY: Use coconut, seeds, avocado
- Dairy (paneer, cheese, ghee, cream) for fat, protein → If DAIRY ALLERGY: Use coconut products, tofu, seeds
- Eggs for protein, binding, fat → If EGG ALLERGY: Use flax/chia eggs, increase tofu, meat
- Almond flour, coconut flour for baking → If NUT ALLERGY: Use ONLY coconut flour, seed flours

KETO + DAIRY ALLERGY:
- Replace paneer → Tofu (firm, pressed)
- Replace ghee → Coconut oil, avocado oil
- Replace cream → Coconut cream
- Replace cheese → Nutritional yeast for flavor
- Increase: Coconut products, avocado, olive oil, fatty fish/meat

KETO + NUT ALLERGY (CHALLENGING):
- NO almond flour, NO almond milk, NO cashew cream, NO nut butters
- Use: Coconut flour (use 1/4 amount compared to almond flour, add more eggs)
- Use: Seed flours (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame)
- Use: Seeds for snacks (sunflower, pumpkin, hemp, chia, flax)
- Use: Coconut products (oil, cream, flakes, butter)
- Emphasize: Vegetables, eggs (if not egg-free), meat/fish, coconut, seeds

KETO + EGG ALLERGY (CHALLENGING):
- NO eggs (major keto protein/fat source)
- Increase: Fatty fish, meat (if non-veg), tofu, tempeh
- Binding: Flax/chia eggs (1 tbsp ground flax + 3 tbsp water)
- Increase: Paneer (if not dairy-free), nuts (if not nut-free)
- Focus: High-fat vegetables (avocado), coconut products, seeds

KETO + DAIRY + NUT ALLERGY (MOST RESTRICTIVE):
- Use: Coconut oil, olive oil, avocado oil, seed oils
- Protein: Tofu, tempeh, eggs (if not egg-free), meat/fish, seeds
- Flour: Coconut flour, seed flours ONLY
- Milk: Coconut milk (full-fat), hemp milk
- This is VERY challenging - meal variety will be limited but achievable

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Allergies take ABSOLUTE PRIORITY over keto macros, taste, cost, variety
- If keto + allergy conflict occurs, ALWAYS eliminate allergen (non-negotiable)
- Be creative with allowed ingredients - coconut and seeds become your best friends
- Always check food labels for hidden allergens
- Cross-contamination is a concern for severe allergies
- "May contain traces of..." warnings should be taken seriously
- Inform restaurants/caterers about allergies
- Carry emergency medication (EpiPen) if prescribed

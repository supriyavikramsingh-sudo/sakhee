## CATEGORY I - CLINICALLY PROVEN SUPPLEMENTS

These supplements have robust clinical trials and meta-analyses supporting their efficacy in PCOS management.

### MYO-INOSITOL AND D-CHIRO-INOSITOL

**Category:** Clinically Proven
**Evidence Level:** Strong (Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses)
**Supplement Type:** Insulin sensitizer, naturally occurring compound

#### Target Symptoms and Conditions
This supplement combination may help with insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, irregular menstrual cycles and anovulation, high androgen levels including testosterone and DHEA, difficulty conceiving and infertility concerns, poor egg quality, and features of metabolic syndrome.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Inositols are insulin-sensitizing compounds that improve how your cells respond to insulin, particularly in ovarian tissue. The combination of myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol in a physiological ratio helps optimize ovarian function and hormone balance. Many women with PCOS see improvements in menstrual regularity within three to six months, with metabolic benefits appearing within two to three months. If you're trying to conceive, fertility benefits typically become apparent after three to six months of consistent use.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
Most women tolerate inositols very well. Some may experience mild gastrointestinal upset such as nausea, bloating, or gas, particularly when first starting. Dizziness is rare but possible. At higher amounts, loose stools may occur. These side effects are generally mild and often resolve as your body adjusts. Taking with food can help minimize digestive discomfort.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Inositols have additive effects with Metformin, meaning they work together to improve insulin sensitivity. If you take insulin or other blood sugar-lowering medications, inositols may enhance their effects, potentially causing blood sugar to drop too low. Close monitoring with your doctor is essential. Inositols may increase the effectiveness of fertility treatments. While generally safe with most medications, inform your healthcare provider about all supplements you take.

BEST FOR: Women with insulin-resistant PCOS phenotype. Particularly effective for restoring ovulation, improving egg quality, and reducing androgen excess.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Menstrual regularity improvements in three to six months, metabolic changes in two to three months, fertility benefits in three to six months.

### VITAMIN D3 (CHOLECALCIFEROL)

**Category:** Clinically Proven
**Evidence Level:** Strong
**Supplement Type:** Vitamin, hormone precursor

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in PCOS, affecting 67-85% of women with the condition. This supplement may help with irregular menstrual periods and anovulation, poor ovulation quality, mood issues including depression and anxiety, insulin resistance, bone health concerns, and immune dysfunction.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Vitamin D functions as a hormone that regulates calcium metabolism, immune function, and insulin sensitivity. Vitamin D receptors are present in ovarian tissue and play an important role in follicular development and hormone synthesis. For women with PCOS, correcting vitamin D deficiency can improve insulin sensitivity, menstrual regularity, and fertility outcomes. Blood level normalization typically takes two to three months, with improvements in menstrual regularity appearing around three to four months. Mood improvements may be noticed within four to eight weeks.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
Vitamin D is generally very safe when taken appropriately. However, excessive supplementation over long periods can raise calcium levels in the blood, which may cause nausea, vomiting, weakness, and in rare cases, kidney stones. Toxicity is rare when staying within recommended guidelines. It's important to get your vitamin D levels tested before starting supplementation and periodically during treatment to ensure optimal dosing.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Thiazide diuretics used for blood pressure may increase calcium levels when combined with vitamin D, so monitoring is important. Be mindful of total calcium intake if you also take calcium supplements. If you take digoxin for heart conditions, high calcium from vitamin D can cause irregular heartbeat. Corticosteroids reduce vitamin D absorption, so higher supplementation may be needed. Take vitamin D with a meal containing healthy fats for better absorption.

BEST FOR: Critical for women with PCOS as deficiency is highly prevalent. Essential to test your levels first. Particularly important for those with insulin resistance, menstrual irregularity, or fertility concerns.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Blood level normalization in two to three months, menstrual regularity in three to four months, mood improvements in four to eight weeks.

### OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS (FISH OIL OR ALGAL DHA)

**Category:** Clinically Proven
**Evidence Level:** Strong
**Supplement Type:** Essential fatty acid, anti-inflammatory

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Omega-3 fatty acids may help with high triglycerides and poor lipid profiles, chronic inflammation throughout the body, insulin resistance, cardiovascular risk factors common in PCOS, mood disorders including depression and anxiety, and menstrual irregularity.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
EPA and DHA, the active omega-3 fatty acids, have powerful anti-inflammatory properties that address the chronic inflammation often present in PCOS. They improve insulin sensitivity by helping your cells respond better to insulin, reduce triglycerides which are often elevated in PCOS, and support hormonal balance. Omega-3s also support mental health through their effects on brain function. You may notice triglyceride reduction within four to six weeks, anti-inflammatory effects within six to eight weeks, and improvements in menstrual regularity around three to four months.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
The most common side effects are minor and include a fishy aftertaste or burps, which can be minimized by taking with meals or choosing a high-quality product. Some people experience loose stools or diarrhea. Nausea may occur. Very rarely, a fishy body odor may develop. Choosing pharmaceutical-grade fish oil or algal DHA (vegetarian source) can help minimize these effects.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Omega-3s have blood-thinning properties, so they may increase bleeding risk when combined with blood thinners like warfarin, aspirin, or clopidogrel. If you take medications for high blood pressure, omega-3s may lower blood pressure further. It's important to stop high amounts of omega-3 supplements one to two weeks before any scheduled surgery. Always inform your surgeon and doctor about omega-3 supplementation.

BEST FOR: Particularly beneficial for women with inflammatory PCOS phenotype and those with metabolic complications like high triglycerides. Helps reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Vegetarians can choose algal DHA.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Triglyceride reduction in four to six weeks, anti-inflammatory effects in six to eight weeks, menstrual regularity in three to four months.

### BERBERINE

**Category:** Clinically Proven
**Evidence Level:** Strong
**Supplement Type:** Plant alkaloid, insulin sensitizer

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Berberine may help with insulin resistance and high blood sugar, poor lipid profile including high cholesterol and triglycerides, high androgen levels, weight management challenges, metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which is common in PCOS.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Berberine activates AMPK, your cellular energy sensor, which improves insulin sensitivity and reduces glucose production in the liver. It has anti-androgenic properties that may help reduce excess male hormones. Often compared to Metformin in efficacy, berberine is an excellent natural alternative or complement for insulin-resistant PCOS. Blood sugar improvements typically appear within two to four weeks, lipid profile changes within six to eight weeks, and menstrual regularity around three to four months. Weight loss effects, when combined with diet and exercise, usually become noticeable after eight to twelve weeks.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
Gastrointestinal side effects are most common, especially when first starting. These may include cramping, diarrhea, gas, or constipation. Nausea and a bitter taste in the mouth may occur. The good news is these effects generally resolve after two to four weeks as your body adjusts. Starting with a lower amount and taking with meals can help minimize discomfort.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Berberine has additive blood sugar-lowering effects with diabetes medications like Metformin and insulin, which can cause blood sugar to drop too low if not monitored. Berberine inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme, which processes many medications, potentially affecting their levels in your body. It may increase levels of cyclosporine. Not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Close monitoring with your healthcare provider is essential, especially if you take diabetes medications.

BEST FOR: Excellent alternative or complement to Metformin for insulin-resistant PCOS. Particularly effective for metabolic PCOS phenotype with high blood sugar, poor lipids, or fatty liver.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Blood sugar improvements in two to four weeks, lipid profile changes in six to eight weeks, menstrual regularity in three to four months, weight loss in eight to twelve weeks with lifestyle changes.

### COENZYME Q10 (COQ10)

**Category:** Clinically Proven
**Evidence Level:** Moderate to Strong
**Supplement Type:** Antioxidant, mitochondrial support

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
CoQ10 may help with ovulatory dysfunction and anovulation, oxidative stress and cellular damage, fatigue and low energy levels, poor egg quality for those trying to conceive, metabolic dysfunction, and overall mitochondrial energy support.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
CoQ10 is a powerful antioxidant and essential component of your mitochondria, the energy powerhouses of your cells. It improves cellular energy production, reduces oxidative stress that can damage eggs and other cells, and enhances oocyte (egg) quality. For women trying to conceive with PCOS, CoQ10 can improve egg quality and ovarian response. Energy level improvements typically appear within two to four weeks. For fertility and egg quality benefits, allow three to six months as oocyte maturation takes time. Improvements in ovulatory function usually appear around two to three months.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
CoQ10 is generally well-tolerated. Some people may experience nausea or mild abdominal discomfort. If taken late in the day, it may cause insomnia due to its energy-boosting effects, so morning or early afternoon is typically best. Very rarely, mild elevation in liver enzymes may occur. Diarrhea or abdominal discomfort is possible but uncommon.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
CoQ10 may reduce the effectiveness of warfarin (blood thinner) by reducing its anticoagulant effect, requiring INR monitoring if you take both. It may reduce the effectiveness of some thyroid medications. CoQ10's antioxidant properties might interfere with certain chemotherapy drugs. It may lower blood pressure slightly, which could be additive with blood pressure medications. Taking with a meal containing fat improves absorption significantly. The ubiquinol form is more bioavailable than ubiquinone.

BEST FOR: Particularly beneficial for women trying to conceive with PCOS. Helps improve egg quality and ovarian response to fertility treatments. Good for fatigue and low energy.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Energy levels improve in two to four weeks, fertility and egg quality benefits in three to six months, ovulatory function in two to three months.

### CHROMIUM PICOLINATE

**Category:** Clinically Proven
**Evidence Level:** Moderate
**Supplement Type:** Mineral, insulin cofactor

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Chromium may help with poor glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, intense carbohydrate and sugar cravings, lipid imbalance, weight management challenges, and features of metabolic syndrome.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Chromium enhances insulin signaling by facilitating insulin receptor binding and improving glucose uptake into your cells. It acts as a cofactor that helps insulin work more effectively. Many women with PCOS find that chromium helps reduce sugar and carbohydrate cravings, which can support weight management efforts. Blood sugar control improvements typically appear within two to four weeks, insulin sensitivity improvements within four to eight weeks, and weight management benefits around eight to twelve weeks when combined with diet and exercise.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
Most women tolerate chromium well. Potential side effects include headache, gastrointestinal upset, and dizziness. At very high amounts over long periods, there is potential for kidney strain, so those with existing kidney issues should use caution and medical supervision. Skin irritation is rare but possible.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Chromium enhances the blood sugar-lowering effects of insulin and diabetes medications, potentially causing hypoglycemia if not monitored. It may affect thyroid hormone levels, so monitoring may be needed if you take thyroid medications. Antacids can reduce chromium absorption, so take them separately. Use caution and close monitoring if you have kidney disease. The picolinate form has the best absorption.

BEST FOR: Helpful for insulin-resistant PCOS, particularly if you struggle with intense carbohydrate cravings. May support metabolic health and weight management efforts.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Blood sugar control in two to four weeks, insulin sensitivity in four to eight weeks, weight management support in eight to twelve weeks.

### CURCUMIN (TURMERIC EXTRACT)

**Category:** Clinically Proven
**Evidence Level:** Moderate
**Supplement Type:** Polyphenol, anti-inflammatory

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Curcumin may help with chronic inflammation throughout the body, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which is common in PCOS, insulin resistance, high androgen levels, oxidative stress and cellular damage, and joint pain.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Curcumin is the active compound in turmeric and is a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. It inhibits inflammatory signaling pathways in your body, improves insulin sensitivity, and has anti-androgenic properties that may help reduce excess male hormones. For women with inflammatory PCOS, curcumin can significantly reduce systemic inflammation. Anti-inflammatory effects typically appear within four to six weeks, insulin sensitivity improvements around six to eight weeks, and liver health markers improve in eight to twelve weeks.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
Curcumin is generally well-tolerated. Some people may experience acid reflux or heartburn, especially at higher amounts. Nausea, diarrhea, or loose stools may occur. Curcumin can cause harmless yellow staining of hands. Mild headache is possible but uncommon.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Curcumin increases bleeding risk when combined with blood thinners like warfarin or aspirin. It may reduce the effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors used for acid reflux. It has additive blood sugar-lowering effects with diabetes medications. It may reduce iron absorption, so take separately from iron supplements if needed. Avoid high amounts before surgery. For better absorption, look for formulations with black pepper extract (piperine) or choose liposomal or phytosome forms. Take with a meal containing fat.

BEST FOR: Excellent for inflammatory PCOS phenotype with high inflammatory markers. Particularly helpful if you have fatty liver. Reduces systemic inflammation and supports metabolic health.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Anti-inflammatory effects in four to six weeks, insulin sensitivity in six to eight weeks, liver health markers in eight to twelve weeks.

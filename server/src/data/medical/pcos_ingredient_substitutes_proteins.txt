--- GENERAL PROTEIN ADAPTATION PRINCIPLES ---

PORTION ADJUSTMENTS:
  - Fish 150g → Paneer/Tofu 150g (same protein content)
  - Chicken 150g → Paneer/Tofu 150g + 1 cup dal (combined protein)
  - Eggs 2 (12g protein) → Tofu 100g (10g protein) + handful nuts

COOKING METHOD PRESERVATION:
  - If fish is FRIED → Fry paneer/tofu the same way
  - If chicken is GRILLED → Grill paneer/tofu with same marinade
  - If eggs are BOILED → Use paneer cubes or small tofu blocks in curry

SPICE/MARINADE COMPATIBILITY:
  - ALL fish marinades work for tofu/paneer
  - ALL chicken marinades work for paneer/soy chunks/tofu
  - ALL egg spice mixes work for tofu scramble

REGIONAL AUTHENTICITY:
  - Keep the dish name authentic: "Goan Fish Curry" becomes "Goan Tofu Curry" (not just "Tofu Curry")
  - Use regional vegetables: Goan dishes add kokum, Kerala adds coconut milk, Bengali adds mustard
  - Maintain traditional spice profiles exactly

TEXTURE MATCHING:
  - For FIRM texture → Pressed tofu, paneer slabs
  - For SOFT texture → Soft tofu, crumbled paneer
  - For CHUNKY texture → Large vegetable pieces, jackfruit
  - For MINCED texture → Crumbled tofu, soya granules, mashed legumes

VARIETY CREATION STRATEGY:
When limited dishes available, create multiple variations:
  - "Goan Fish Curry" → 3 VARIATIONS:
    1. "Goan Tofu Curry (Vegan Version)" - firm tofu cubes
    2. "Goan Paneer Curry (Vegetarian Version)" - paneer cubes
    3. "Goan Mixed Vegetable Curry (Jain Version)" - cauliflower, beans, pumpkin, no onion/garlic

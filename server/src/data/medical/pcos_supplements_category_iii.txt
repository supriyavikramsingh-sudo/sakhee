## CATEGORY III - AYURVEDIC / HERBAL SUPPORT (TRADITIONAL + MODERN EVIDENCE)

These are traditional Ayurvedic herbs with centuries of use and emerging modern research. Particularly relevant for Indian women with PCOS.

### ASHWAGANDHA (WITHANIA SOMNIFERA)

**Category:** Ayurvedic / Adaptogen
**Evidence Level:** Moderate (stress, cortisol regulation)
**Supplement Type:** Adaptogenic herb

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Ashwagandha may help with elevated cortisol and chronic stress, stress-related hormonal imbalance, fatigue and low energy, anxiety and mood disorders, mild insulin resistance, sleep disturbances, and thyroid dysfunction particularly hypothyroidism.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Ashwagandha is an adaptogen that helps your body manage stress by modulating the HPA axis (your stress response system). It reduces cortisol levels, has anti-inflammatory properties, and may enhance thyroid function. For women with stress-driven PCOS and elevated cortisol, ashwagandha can be particularly helpful. It's especially beneficial for the adrenal PCOS phenotype. Stress reduction typically appears within two to four weeks. Cortisol normalization takes four to eight weeks. Energy improvements appear in two to four weeks. Thyroid effects take six to eight weeks.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
Drowsiness or sedation may occur, especially at higher amounts or when first starting. Gastrointestinal upset including nausea or diarrhea is possible. Because ashwagandha can stimulate thyroid function, it may cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism if amounts are too high. Rarely, liver enzyme elevation may occur with long-term high amounts.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Ashwagandha may enhance thyroid hormone levels, so if you take thyroid medications, close monitoring with your doctor is essential. It has additive sedative effects with CNS depressants and sleep medications. It may have additive effects with SSRIs and other antidepressants. It may stimulate the immune system, so use caution with immunosuppressants. Use caution if you have hyperthyroidism. Avoid in pregnancy without medical supervision. Take with meals. Evening timing may help with sleep.

BEST FOR: Particularly helpful for women with stress-driven PCOS and elevated cortisol. May help with adrenal PCOS phenotype. Supports thyroid health, which is a common issue alongside PCOS.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Stress reduction in two to four weeks, cortisol normalization in four to eight weeks, energy improvements in two to four weeks, thyroid effects in six to eight weeks.

### SHATAVARI (ASPARAGUS RACEMOSUS)

**Category:** Ayurvedic
**Evidence Level:** Traditional use + Limited modern research
**Supplement Type:** Herbal adaptogen, reproductive tonic

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Shatavari may help with hormonal imbalance and dysregulation, menstrual irregularity, fertility concerns and reproductive health support, breast milk production after giving birth, and menopausal symptoms.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Shatavari is considered a female reproductive tonic in Ayurveda and has been used for centuries. It contains phytoestrogens and saponins that may help modulate hormonal balance and support reproductive tissues. Traditional Ayurvedic medicine considers it particularly beneficial for women's reproductive health. Menstrual regularity improvements may appear after two to three cycles. For fertility support, allow three to six months. General hormonal balance effects take six to eight weeks.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
Shatavari is generally very safe. Rare gastrointestinal upset or bloating may occur. Allergic reactions are possible if you're allergic to the asparagus family.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Because shatavari contains phytoestrogens, it may have additive effects with hormonal medications like birth control or hormone replacement therapy. It may interact with estrogen therapy. It has mild diuretic properties. Use caution with estrogen-sensitive conditions like breast cancer or endometriosis. Can be taken as extract or powder mixed with warm milk or water. Daily consistent use is recommended.

BEST FOR: Traditional Ayurvedic remedy for female reproductive health. May help regulate menstrual cycles and support fertility in PCOS.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Menstrual regularity in two to three cycles, fertility support in three to six months, general hormonal balance in six to eight weeks.

### TRIPHALA

**Category:** Ayurvedic
**Evidence Level:** Traditional use + Moderate modern research
**Supplement Type:** Herbal combination (three fruits)

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Triphala may help with digestive sluggishness and constipation, gut detoxification and cleansing, inflammation, mild insulin resistance, weight management support, and antioxidant support.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Triphala is a traditional Ayurvedic combination of three fruits (Amalaki, Bibhitaki, and Haritaki) with digestive, detoxifying, and antioxidant properties. It supports bowel regularity, which is a common issue in PCOS, and metabolic health. Bowel regularity improvements typically appear within one to three days. Digestive improvements take one to two weeks. Detoxification effects appear around two to four weeks.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
Loose stools or diarrhea may occur, especially at higher amounts. Abdominal cramping is possible. Dehydration may occur if diarrhea is excessive. Generally safe when used appropriately.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Triphala may increase fluid loss when combined with diuretics. It has additive laxative effects with other laxatives. It may lower blood sugar, so monitor if you take diabetes medications. Avoid during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Not recommended for long-term daily use without breaks. Can be taken as tablets, capsules, or powder mixed with warm water, often before bed.

BEST FOR: Supports digestive health and regularity, a common issue in PCOS. May help with gentle detoxification and weight management support.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Bowel regularity in one to three days, digestive improvements in one to two weeks, detoxification effects in two to four weeks.

### LICORICE ROOT (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA)

**Category:** Ayurvedic / Herbal
**Evidence Level:** Moderate (cortisol, androgen modulation)
**Supplement Type:** Herbal extract

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Licorice root may help with cortisol dysregulation, high androgen levels, adrenal fatigue, digestive issues like ulcers or gastritis, and hirsutism.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Licorice contains glycyrrhizin which inhibits cortisol breakdown (which can raise cortisol when needed) and has anti-androgenic properties. It blocks the 5-alpha reductase enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT, the more potent androgen responsible for hirsutism and acne. For androgen reduction, allow four to eight weeks. Hirsutism improvements take three to six months as hair growth is slow.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
The major concern with licorice is that it can raise blood pressure, sometimes significantly. It lowers potassium levels, which can be dangerous. Water retention and edema may occur. Headache and fatigue are possible. These hormonal effects require monitoring.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Licorice counteracts the effect of blood pressure medications, making them less effective. It interacts with diuretics, especially potassium-sparing types. It has additive cortisol effects with corticosteroids. Low potassium from licorice increases the toxicity risk of digoxin for heart conditions. Contraindicated if you have hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, or low potassium. Not recommended during pregnancy. Use only for short-term periods (not more than four to six weeks continuously) under medical supervision. For digestive issues, DGL (deglycyrrhizinated licorice) is safer as it removes glycyrrhizin.

BEST FOR: May help with androgen-related symptoms like hirsutism. Use with extreme caution due to blood pressure effects. Not recommended for long-term use. Medical supervision essential.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Androgen reduction in four to eight weeks, hirsutism in three to six months.

### AMLA (INDIAN GOOSEBERRY / PHYLLANTHUS EMBLICA)

**Category:** Ayurvedic
**Evidence Level:** Traditional use + Emerging research
**Supplement Type:** Fruit, antioxidant

#### TARGET SYMPTOMS AND CONDITIONS
Amla may help with antioxidant support and reducing oxidative stress, insulin sensitivity, hair health and premature graying, skin health, immune support, and lipid metabolism.

#### HOW IT HELPS YOU
Amla is extremely rich in Vitamin C and polyphenols, making it a powerful antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and metabolic benefits. It supports collagen production for hair and skin health and cellular health throughout your body. Amla is considered very safe for long-term use. Antioxidant benefits typically appear within four to six weeks. Hair health improvements take three to six months as hair growth is slow. Metabolic improvements appear around six to eight weeks.

#### POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS
Amla is extremely safe with no significant side effects when used in normal amounts. Mild digestive changes may occur initially. At very high amounts, it may lower blood sugar slightly.

#### DRUG INTERACTIONS AND IMPORTANT CAUTIONS
Amla may enhance blood sugar-lowering effects of diabetes medications, so monitoring may be needed. Generally very safe. High amounts may affect iron absorption, so take separately from iron supplements if needed. Can be taken as extract, powder mixed with water or honey, or fresh juice.

BEST FOR: Excellent antioxidant for overall health in PCOS. May support insulin sensitivity and hair health. Very safe for long-term use.

WHEN TO EXPECT RESULTS: Antioxidant benefits in four to six weeks, hair health in three to six months, metabolic improvements in six to eight weeks.

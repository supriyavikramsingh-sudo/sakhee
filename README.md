# üå∏ Sakhee ‚Äî AI-powered PCOS Management Assistant

Sakhee is an AI-driven, culturally-localized health companion focused on helping Indian women manage PCOS/PCOD. It combines a React + Vite frontend with an Express backend that leverages language models and retrieval pipelines (LangChain.js) for personalized chat, meal planning, medical report parsing, and progress tracking.

This README covers how to get the project running locally, available scripts, environment variables, features, and code organization.

--### Development Notes

### Server

- Uses **LangChain.js + OpenAI** for chat and RAG
- Keep the OpenAI key in `server/.env` (never commit)
- Auto-restarts on file changes with `node --watch`
- Uploaded files stored temporarily in `server/src/storage/tmpUploads`
- Vector store cached in `server/src/storage/localCache/vectordb`
- **RAG System**:
  - Meal templates stored as `.txt` files in `server/src/data/meal_templates/`
  - Run `npm run ingest:meals` after adding/updating templates
  - Server checks RAG status on startup and logs warnings if not initialized
  - Vector store uses HNSWLib for fast similarity search
  - Each meal plan includes RAG metadata showing retrieval quality and sources used
- **Meal Plan Generation**:

  - Plans are generated in chunks (3 days max per LLM call) for reliability
  - Structure validation ensures consistent JSON format
  - Fallback templates used if AI generation fails
  - All plans stored in-memory (consider migrating to Firestore for persistence)

Features

- **ü§ñ AI Chat Assistant** - Conversational AI powered by GPT-4o-mini with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for PCOS-specific guidance
- **üçΩÔ∏è Personalized Meal Planning** - AI-generated meal plans tailored to Indian cuisine and PCOS dietary needs with:
  - RAG-powered knowledge retrieval from curated meal templates and nutrition guidelines
  - Transparent personalization sources showing what influenced each plan (onboarding data, medical reports, RAG knowledge base)
  - Visual RAG metadata display showing knowledge base coverage and sources used
  - Automatic chunking for longer meal plans to ensure reliability
  - PDF export functionality for all meals
  - Regional cuisine variations (North, South, East, West Indian)
- **üìÑ Medical Report Analysis** - OCR-based parsing of lab reports (PDF, DOCX, images) with intelligent data extraction and integration into meal plan generation
- **üìä Progress Tracking** - Visual dashboards to monitor health metrics, symptoms, and lifestyle changes over time
- **üåê Multi-language Support** - English and Hindi with i18next internationalization
- **üîê Firebase Authentication** - Secure Google OAuth login with Firestore for user profiles and data persistence
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Privacy** - Content safety guards, rate limiting, and medical disclaimers
- **üîÑ Community Insights** - Reddit integration for anonymized community experiences (optional)

Testing Community Insights & Clickable Links

- Quick test: send a community-style question to the chat endpoint and look for a concise assistant reply that includes a final markdown-formatted links block (e.g. `[title](https://reddit.com/...)`). The frontend converts markdown links into clickable anchors.
- Example curl payload to test the chat endpoint (replace `USER_ID` and `API_KEY` as needed):

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"USER_ID","message":"Are there any women in India who treated PCOS acne with Ayurveda?"}'
```

- What to look for:
  - Backend logs show `needsCommunityInsights()` triggered and `fetchRedditContext()` returned top posts.
  - Assistant reply contains a short empathic opening, a 3‚Äì5 bullet set of RAG-backed recommendations, and a `üìö Community discussions` section with markdown links.
  - Links in the frontend chat UI are clickable (open in a new tab). If links are plain URLs, see the Troubleshooting section about frontend markdown rendering.

- **üé® Modern UI** - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons, and Recharts visualizations
- **üîç RAG System Status** - Real-time monitoring of RAG system health, vector store status, and template indexing

## üöÄ Quick Setup (Development)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **npm** (or yarn)
- **OpenAI API key** (required)
- **Firebase project** with Authentication and Firestore enabled (required)
- **SERP API key** (optional, for web search context)
- **Reddit OAuth credentials** (optional, for community insights)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd sakhee
npm install
```

2. **Configure environment variables**

**Server** (`server/.env`):

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Edit `server/.env` and add your keys:

```bash
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Required: OpenAI API
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: SERP API for web search
SERP_API_KEY=your_serp_api_key_here

# Optional: Reddit OAuth (Personal Script App)
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
REDDIT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/reddit/callback

# Security
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
DATABASE_URL=local
```

**Client** (`client/.env`):

```bash
cp client/.env.example client/.env
```

Edit `client/.env` and add your Firebase config:

```bash
# API
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_API_TIMEOUT=30000

# App
VITE_APP_NAME=Sakhee
VITE_VERSION=1.0.0

# Required: Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

3. **Initialize RAG system (Optional but Recommended)**

To enable full RAG functionality with meal templates:

```bash
# Create meal templates folder (if not exists)
mkdir -p server/src/data/meal_templates

# Add your meal template .txt files to the folder
# Each template should contain meal information, recipes, and nutrition data

# Index the templates into the vector store
cd server
npm run ingest:meals
```

The server will work without this step but will use fallback templates instead of RAG retrieval.

4. **Start development servers**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:

- **Client**: http://localhost:5173
- **Server**: http://localhost:5000

You can also start each part separately:

```bash
# Server only
cd server && npm run dev

# Client only
cd client && npm run dev
```

## üß≠ Vector DB management (server side)

The project uses an HNSWLib vector store stored under `server/src/storage/localCache/vectordb`.
For development and maintenance there are a few helper scripts in `server/src/scripts/` to inspect, back up, clear and restore the vector store.

Important: run these from the `server` folder (or use `cd server` first). The scripts assume the server-relative storage path. If your repo path contains spaces, the scripts are already quoted to avoid child-process path truncation issues.

Common commands (run inside `server`):

- npm run vector:health ‚Äî run a quick health check (checks files, loads index, runs a small similarity query)
- npm run vector:backup ‚Äî creates a timestamped backup of the current vector store under `server/backups/vectorstore/`
- npm run vector:clear ‚Äî backs up then clears the vector store (interactive confirmation)
- npm run vector:list ‚Äî lists the files in the vector store folder and a rough document count
- npm run vector:restore -- <backup-folder> ‚Äî restores a backup folder into `server/src/storage/localCache/vectordb`

Notes & recent fixes

- All vector scripts were updated to use server-relative paths (previously some scripts pointed to the wrong `src` path and failed to find the vector store).
- The master ingestion launcher was fixed to quote child-process invocations so `node "${scriptPath}"` works even when the repository path contains spaces.
- Meal template ingestion was updated to extract individual meal entries (#### level) instead of only category-level docs (###). If you re-index after this fix you should see many more meal documents (previously ~149, now ~1,300+ depending on templates).
- Recommended workflow to re-index safely:
  1. cd server
  2. npm run vector:backup
  3. npm run vector:clear (confirm)
  4. npm run ingest:all (or `npm run ingest:meals` / `npm run ingest:medical` / `npm run ingest:nutrition`)
  5. npm run vector:health

If you want this automated in CI, consider adding a guarded task that runs the backup + ingest + health-check and fails loudly if the health check does not return expected counts.

## RAG System Architecture

### Overview

Sakhee uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance meal plan personalization with a curated knowledge base of meal templates, nutritional guidelines, and PCOS-specific dietary recommendations.

### Components

**1. Vector Store (HNSWLib)**

- Fast similarity search for meal templates
- Stores embeddings of meal data, recipes, and nutrition guidelines
- Located at: `server/src/storage/localCache/vectordb/`

**2. Embeddings (OpenAI)**

- Uses `text-embedding-3-small` model
- Converts meal templates to dense vector representations
- Enables semantic search across knowledge base

**3. Meal Templates**

- Stored as `.txt` files in `server/src/data/meal_templates/`
- Each template contains regional meal variations with:
  - Meal name, ingredients, and quantities
  - Macros (protein, carbs, fats) and glycemic index
  - Cooking instructions and tips
- Organized by region (North, South, East, West Indian)

**4. Ingestion Pipeline**

- Script: `server/src/scripts/ingestMealTemplates.js`
- Reads all `.txt` files from templates folder
- Splits documents into chunks
- Generates embeddings and builds vector store
- Run with: `npm run ingest:meals`

**5. Retrieval & Generation**

- Query user preferences to retrieve relevant templates
- Top-k similarity search (configurable, default k=5)
- Retrieved context injected into LLM prompt
- RAG metadata tracked for transparency:
  - Number of templates used
  - Nutrition guidelines applied
  - Symptom-specific recommendations
  - Retrieval quality score (high/medium/low)

### RAG Status Monitoring

Check RAG system health:

```bash
# Detailed status
curl http://localhost:5000/api/rag/status

# Quick health check
curl http://localhost:5000/api/rag/health
```

Response includes:

- Vector store existence
- Template count and file names
- Indexed document count (approximate)
- Retrieval functionality status
- Recommendations for fixes

### RAG Quality Metrics

Each meal plan includes personalization metadata:

```json
{
  "personalizationSources": {
    "onboarding": true,
    "medicalReport": true,
    "userOverrides": false,
    "ragQuality": "high",
    "ragSources": {
      "mealTemplates": 5,
      "nutritionGuidelines": 8,
      "symptomRecommendations": true
    }
  }
}
```

Quality levels:

- **High**: 5+ relevant templates retrieved, comprehensive guidelines
- **Medium**: 2-4 templates retrieved, partial guidelines
- **Low**: 0-1 templates retrieved, fallback mode

### Adding New Templates

1. Create `.txt` file in `server/src/data/meal_templates/`
2. Format with meal name, ingredients, macros, and tips
3. Run ingestion: `cd server && npm run ingest:meals`
4. Restart server
5. Verify: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/rag/status`

Example template format:

```
Meal: South Indian Idli Sambar
Region: south-india
Type: breakfast
Ingredients: 3 idlis (150g), sambar (200ml), coconut chutney (50g)
Protein: 12g
Carbs: 45g
Fats: 5g
GI: Low
Time: 20 mins
Tip: Use brown rice idlis for extra fiber and lower GI
```

## üöß Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 5000 is already in use:

```bash
# Find process using the port
lsof -iTCP:5000 -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P

# Kill the process
kill <PID>

# Or use a different port
PORT=5001 npm run dev
```

### Firebase Configuration Issues

- Ensure all Firebase environment variables are set in `client/.env`
- Enable Google Authentication in Firebase Console
- Create Firestore database in Firebase Console
- Configure Firestore security rules

### OpenAI API Issues

- Check API key is valid and has credits
- Verify model name is correct (`gpt-4o-mini`)
- Check rate limits on OpenAI dashboard

### RAG System Issues

**Vector Store Not Found**:

```bash
# Create templates folder if missing
mkdir -p server/src/data/meal_templates

# Add .txt template files with meal data
# Then run ingestion
cd server && npm run ingest:meals
```

**Templates Not Being Used**:

- Check RAG status: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/rag/status`
- Verify templates exist: `ls server/src/data/meal_templates/*.txt`
- Re-ingest templates: `npm run ingest:meals`
- Check server logs for RAG initialization messages

**Meal Plans Using Fallback Templates**:

- This happens when vector store is not initialized
- Run `npm run ingest:meals` in the server directory
- Restart the server after ingestion
- Check for "‚úÖ RAG system initialized successfully" in logs

### Module Not Found Errors

```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Or in specific workspace
cd client && rm -rf node_modules && npm install
cd server && rm -rf node_modules && npm install

**Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è for women managing PCOS**

### New in v1.2.0

Small maintenance and UX improvements landed after v1.1.0 to make the chat + meal planning flows safer, more robust and more user-friendly:

- Chat -> Meal Plan redirect (server + client)

  - Added middleware on the chat route to detect meal-plan requests and block them from invoking the LLM. Instead the server returns a structured `MEAL_PLAN_REDIRECT` response. This protects against the LLM generating free-form meal plans in chat and keeps meal plan generation scoped to the dedicated Meal Plan Generator.
  - Frontend now displays a dedicated `MealPlanRedirectCard` when the redirect response is returned. The card includes CTA, short features list, help text and an action URL to the meal planner.

- UI / content tweaks for the redirect card

  - The phrase "Meal Plan Generator" is now rendered as bold in the redirect message (HTML-safe rendering with controlled styling).
  - Updated feature copy shown on the card (3/5/7-day options and ingredient/substitution details).

- Chat timestamp handling

  - Messages now display reliable timestamps across environments. The chat bubble rendering code was hardened to accept Firestore Timestamp objects, objects with `seconds`, ISO strings and unix timestamps so "Invalid Date" no longer appears.

- Miscellaneous bug fixes and stability improvements
  - Fixed incorrect user id usage in the chat page (use `user.uid` instead of `user.id`) so requests and history load correctly.
  - Fixed `dotenv` import/path issues used by ingestion scripts (ensures `.env` loads correctly when running ingestion from the project root).
  - Added helpful debug logging in a few client modules to make API troubleshooting easier during development.

These changes aim to make the experience safer (no ad-hoc meal plans from chat), clearer for users, and easier to debug for developers.

### New in v1.3.0

Significant feature and stability improvements landed in v1.3.0 focused on nutrition accuracy, UX polishing, and robustness across the chat + meal planning flows.

- Calories everywhere

  - LLM prompt and validation updated so each generated meal now includes a calorie estimate (kcal). The prompt enforces calories using the formula: (protein √ó 4) + (carbs √ó 4) + (fats √ó 9).
  - Server-side fallback and repair now calculate calories when the model omits them.
  - Hardcoded fallback templates were updated to include calories.

- Daily 2000 kcal enforcement

  - New requirement: each day's meals are validated and adjusted to target ~2000 kcal (acceptable range 1900‚Äì2100 kcal).
  - Implementation details: `validateAndAdjustCalories()` scales macros proportionally and performs a fine-tune pass to hit the daily target while preserving PCOS-friendly ratios.
  - Fallback plan generation also scales templates to meet the daily calorie target when RAG is unavailable.

- Frontend: Meal UI and transparency

  - `MealCard` now displays Calories alongside Protein / Carbs / Fats in the nutrition grid. If calories are missing, the UI computes them from macros as a fallback.
  - `MealPlanDisplay` shows a clear disclaimer about the baseline assumptions used for calorie calculations (moderately active adult woman, ~5'2"‚Äì5'4", 56 kg).
  - PDF export (jsPDF) includes nutrition info; calorie values are now included in exported meal plans.

- Chat and message UX improvements

  - Pagination added to chat history: only the most recent 5 messages load initially with a "Load older messages" button to fetch 5 more at a time.
  - Auto-scroll behavior refined: when user clicks "Load older messages" the UI preserves scroll position and does NOT jump to the bottom; normal auto-scroll still happens on new incoming messages.
  - Fixed message duplication on re-renders by adding a one-time history loader and replacing (not appending) messages when loading history.

- Reliability & debugging

  - Improved logging for meal generation (RAG retrieval counts, calorie totals, adjustment logs) to make troubleshooting easier.
  - Fixed several issues encountered during testing (dotenv fixes, correct Firebase `user.uid` usage in chat page, and more).

- Files / areas touched (high level)

### New in v1.4.0

Focused fixes and UX improvements landed after v1.3.0 to improve medical report parsing accuracy, reduce LLM hallucinations from optional community sources, and present cycle-dependent hormones more appropriately in the UI.

- Parser & Medical Report Analysis

  - Fixed extraction logic so Free T3 and Free T4 are parsed correctly (value-after-unit/range pattern handling). This prevents T3 values being mis-assigned to T4.
  - Fixed parsing for Estradiol, Progesterone, Vitamin D and Vitamin B12 across typical lab report formats. Vitamin D values reported in ng/mL are now converted to nmol/L when required.
  - Added more robust fallback/snippet extraction and structured debug logging to help diagnose unmatched fields and speed future parser improvements.
  - Added a local parser test harness used during development: `server/test_parser_final.mjs` (developer-only test script).

- Backend updates

  - `server/src/services/parserService.js` ‚Äî improved regex patterns, conversion utilities, fallback snippet extraction, and extended logging.
  - `server/src/utils/labRanges.js` ‚Äî introduced `skipSeverity` and `cycleDependentNote` flags for cycle-dependent hormones; `getLabSeverity()` respects the new flag and returns a `cycle-dependent` state.

- Frontend / UX

  - `client/src/components/files/ReportAnalysis.jsx` ‚Äî UI updated to treat estradiol and progesterone as "cycle-dependent": the app no longer shows normal/abnormal severity badges for these labs. Instead an info-style card displays per-phase reference ranges so users can interpret results based on their cycle phase.
  - Severity icons/colors/labels updated to include a `cycle-dependent`/info state.

- RAG / Chat anti-hallucination improvements

  - The chat/RAG pipeline now explicitly injects an anti-fabrication note when optional Reddit/community data is not available, preventing the LLM from inventing community posts as sources.
  - Additional logging was added around the RAG context construction so triggers like `needsCommunityInsights()` and what was injected are auditable in logs.

- Tests, Docs & Developer aids

  - Created `CYCLE_DEPENDENT_HORMONES_UPDATE.md` (developer doc) summarizing the change and showing reference ranges used in the UI.
  - Parser test harness (see above) and enhanced logs to make reproducing failures and writing unit tests easier.

- Why this matters

  - Medical report parsing is a core trust surface for the app: improving extraction accuracy reduces false alerts and prevents incorrect personalization of meal plans.
  - Cycle-dependent labeling avoids presenting misleading severity information for hormones whose interpretation depends on cycle timing.
  - Anti-hallucination changes improve user trust by ensuring the system doesn't invent community anecdotes when community data isn't present.

- Next / Planned
  - Optional UI: add a cycle-phase selector on report upload so users who provide cycle phase can receive automated interpretation (re-enable severity for estradiol/progesterone when phase is known).
  - Add automated unit tests for `parserService` regexes and CI checks to avoid regressions.
  - Expand RAG/chat regression tests to verify anti-hallucination behavior across more prompts.

### New in v1.5.0

Focused delivery and bug fixes to the medical report analysis feature, developer tooling, and several robustness/UX issues landed in v1.5.0.

- Medical Report: single-file workflow

  - Users can now upload exactly one medical report at a time. Each upload replaces the previous report (the previous document is deleted server-side) so the UI always shows the user's current report.
  - Server persistence: reports are stored in Firestore under a single document per user (convention: `users/{userId}/medicalReport/current`). The server performs sanitization of fields before saving to avoid Firestore INVALID_ARGUMENT errors.
  - Non-blocking saves: file processing and AI analysis return success to the client quickly; Firestore saves are performed in a resilient, non-blocking way so transient DB issues don't block the user flow.

- New/changed server files

  - `server/src/services/medicalReportService.js` ‚Äî CRUD for single-report-per-user, sanitization helpers (`sanitizeData`, `sanitizeFieldName`) and document size validation.
  - `server/src/routes/upload.js` ‚Äî Upload endpoints and orchestration (file extraction ‚Üí parser ‚Üí AI analysis ‚Üí enqueue DB save). New endpoints include the upload and user-report CRUD routes (POST /api/upload/report, GET /api/upload/user/:userId/report, DELETE /api/upload/user/:userId/report).
  - `server/src/storage/tmpUploads/` ‚Äî temporary storage for incoming files during processing.

- New/changed client files

  - `client/src/pages/ReportsPage.jsx` ‚Äî main Reports page UI: shows current report card, replace/delete UX, and loads the report on mount. Fixed previous auth store import issues and hardened loading states.
  - `client/src/components/files/FileUpload.jsx` ‚Äî simplified single-file upload component that returns the new report payload and closes the upload flow.
  - `client/src/components/files/ReportAnalysis.jsx` ‚Äî improved header and timestamp handling; treats cycle-dependent hormones appropriately (see v1.4.0 notes) and shows formatted uploaded timestamp.
  - `client/src/services/apiClient.js` & `client/src/services/firestoreService.js` ‚Äî new helper methods for the single-report endpoints (uploadFile, getUserReport, deleteUserReport, hasUserReport).
  - `client/src/store/authStore.js` ‚Äî ensured correct auth store import and usage across reports/chat pages.

- Timestamp handling fix

  - The client now robustly handles multiple uploadedAt formats: Firestore-style serialized objects with `seconds`/`nanoseconds`, Firestore Timestamp instances, ISO strings, and JS Date objects. This prevents "Invalid Date" from appearing in the UI after uploads/refreshes.

- Data sanitization and Firestore reliability

  - To avoid INVALID_ARGUMENT errors the server sanitizes report payloads: removes undefined/NaN values, strips illegal Firestore field name characters, and limits very large text fields.
  - Note: during development the Web (client) Firestore SDK is used on the server in some helper code; for production we recommend migrating server code that writes to Firestore to the Firebase Admin SDK to avoid client-offline/credential limitations.

- Developer docs & helper scripts added

  - `MEDICAL_REPORT_FEATURE.md` ‚Äî feature doc & quick reference for the new single-file report flow.
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` / `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` / `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` ‚Äî implementation notes and checklist for reviewers.
  - `start-medical-report-test.sh` ‚Äî helper for local test runs (developer convenience).

- Testing & verification notes

  - After pulling changes that modify server-side code, restart the server (Ctrl+C in the server terminal, then `npm run dev`) so new routes and services are loaded.
  - Use the Report page to upload a report and check browser console logs if you see "Invalid Date" ‚Äî the client prints the raw `uploadedAt` object when loading the report to aid debugging.

- Known issues & recommendations

  - Firestore persistence can appear intermittent in local development due to using the Firebase Web SDK in some server paths. Recommendation: migrate `server/src/config/firebase.js` to use the Firebase Admin SDK (server-side) for reliable server writes in production.
  - The app performs non-blocking saves; if you expect deterministic, synchronous persistence (for example for critical audit trails) review `medicalReportService.saveReport()` and consider awaiting the Firestore write or adding retry/backoff logic.

- Files/areas touched (quick list)
  - Server: `server/src/services/medicalReportService.js`, `server/src/routes/upload.js`, `server/src/config/firebase.js` (notes), `server/src/storage/tmpUploads/`
  - Client: `client/src/pages/ReportsPage.jsx`, `client/src/components/files/FileUpload.jsx`, `client/src/components/files/ReportAnalysis.jsx`, `client/src/services/apiClient.js`, `client/src/services/firestoreService.js`, `client/src/store/authStore.js`
  - Docs: `MEDICAL_REPORT_FEATURE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `FIRESTORE_FIXES.md`

### New in v1.6.0

Small but important UX, frontend plumbing, and styling fixes focused on ensuring medical report data is actually used in personalization and cleaning up the Reports UI.

- Meal plan personalization plumbing

  - `MealPlanGenerator.jsx` now fetches the user's latest medical report on mount and immediately before generating a meal plan. The fetched report is included in the request body as `healthContext.medicalData` so the backend receives lab values and can incorporate lab-specific guidance into meal generation.
  - This fixes cases where `hasLabValues` / `hasMedicalData` were reported as false even though a report existed in Firestore (the client previously wasn't including the report in the generation request).
  - The component now exposes `userReport` state for display and uses it when calculating `displayPersonalizationSources`.

- Report analysis UI improvements

  - `ReportAnalysis.jsx` was updated to:
    - Parse AI analysis sections more robustly and remove stray standalone numbers (e.g., lines containing only "2.") except inside the `Next Steps` section where numbered lists are desired.
    - Render lab value categories as accessible accordions (Thyroid Function, Vitamins, Hormones, etc.). All accordions are collapsed on load except the first category which is expanded by default.
    - Preserve existing cycle-dependent hormone handling and improved severity display.

- Styling / CSS fixes

  - `client/src/styles/index.css` was cleaned up to avoid using `@apply` inside `@keyframes` and to split scrollbar thumb hover rules into proper selectors. These changes prevent build-time and linter warnings and keep Tailwind usage compatible with PostCSS/Tailwind processing.

- Backend & RAG improvements (refresher)

  - `mealPlanChain.js` includes enhanced lab-guidance support: `buildLabGuidanceQuery()`, `categorizeLabs()`, and integration of lab-specific RAG context into the prompt. This allows the LLM to prioritize evidence-based dietary guidance when abnormal lab values exist.

- Developer notes & testing

  - After pulling frontend changes, restart dev servers to ensure new client-side fetching logic is active. The meal generator now logs whether a report was found and how many lab values were passed in (helpful for debugging personalization).
  - If you still see `hasLabValues: false` in server logs after these changes, confirm the report document exists at `users/{userId}/medicalReport/current` in Firestore and that the client is authenticated and able to read it.

- Files/areas touched (v1.6.0)
  - Client: `client/src/components/meal/MealPlanGenerator.jsx`, `client/src/components/files/ReportAnalysis.jsx`, `client/src/styles/index.css`
  - Server: `server/src/langchain/chains/mealPlanChain.js` (lab guidance helpers)

If you'd like, I can also add a short troubleshooting snippet to the README showing how to verify the medical report document in Firestore and an example curl command to call the meal generation endpoint including `healthContext.medicalData`.

### New in v1.7.0

Major improvements to the chat experience, especially around integrating users' medical reports (lab values) into conversational responses, safer output disclaimers, and route plumbing to ensure the chat pipeline can fetch and use lab data.

- Lab-aware Chat (server-side)

  - `server/src/langchain/chains/chatChain.js` was expanded into a full lab-aware chat pipeline:
    - `buildEnhancedSystemPrompt()` ‚Äî stronger system-level instructions to prioritize lab data, RAG context, safety rules, and response structure for three common scenarios (symptom query, lab interpretation, community insights).
    - `getUserLabValues(userId)` ‚Äî server helper that fetches the user's medical report and extracts lab values, uploadedAt and analysis for use in chat.
    - `buildLabContext(medicalData)` / `categorizeLabs()` ‚Äî create prioritized, human-readable lab context that is injected into prompts so the LLM references exact lab values when answering.
    - `buildLabGuidanceQuery()` ‚Äî generates targeted RAG queries (dietary guidance) based on abnormal labs and the user's message to retrieve lab-specific recommendations from the vector store.
    - `processMessage()` ‚Äî orchestrates retrievals (medical knowledge, lab-guidance, Reddit community insights, SERP nutrition data), builds the final prompt, invokes the conversation chain, and returns structured sources and a `contextUsed` summary.

- Safer disclaimers (no duplication)

  - The chat chain previously appended static disclaimers unconditionally which sometimes resulted in duplicate disclaimers when the LLM already included one. The chain now checks the model output (case-insensitive substring matching) and only appends the general, lab-specific, or community disclaimers if they are not already present. This reduces noisy/duplicated safety text while ensuring required statements are present.

- Chat route plumbing & middleware

  - `server/src/routes/chat.js` updated to always pass `userId` (via `userContext`) into `chatChain.processMessage()` so the chain can fetch lab values server-side.
  - `mealPlanIntentDetector` middleware remains integrated to redirect meal-plan requests safely and consistently.

- Client-side: lab context UI

  - `client/src/components/chat/LabContextBadge.jsx` (new) ‚Äî small UI component (badge/display) to show whether lab context was used for a chat response and quick stats (lab count, last uploaded date). This helps users see when their medical data influenced the reply.

- Developer & debugging notes

  - The chat pipeline returns `contextUsed` and `sources` with each response. `contextUsed.labValues` and `contextUsed.labGuidance` are useful indicators when testing whether lab-based personalization worked.
  - If you run integration tests and `labValues` are not detected, confirm the medical report exists at `users/{userId}/medicalReport/current` and the server can read it (authentication/permissions).
  - There is a local test harness for lab-chat integration (dev-only). If it fails, check `server` logs for Retriever and Reddit/SERP fetch failures.

- Files/areas touched (v1.7.0)
  - Server: `server/src/langchain/chains/chatChain.js`, `server/src/routes/chat.js`, (uses `medicalReportService` + retriever + redditService + serpService)
  - Client: `client/src/components/chat/LabContextBadge.jsx`
  - Middleware: `server/src/middleware/mealPlanIntentDetector.js` (usage continued)

If you'd like, I can add an example cURL payload that demonstrates how `userId` and `userContext` are passed to `/api/chat/message` and what the server returns (including `contextUsed`).

# PCOS-Friendly Nutrition Guidance Enhancement

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Version**: v1.8.2

## Issue

When users ask about nutritional information for dishes (e.g., "What are the nutritional breakdown of dal dhokli?"), the bot provides:
- ‚úÖ Nutrition facts (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
- ‚úÖ Source links (Google SERP)
- ‚ùå **Missing: PCOS-friendly alternatives and ingredient substitutions**

This is a critical gap because:
- Many Indian dishes are high-carb, low-protein, or fried - not ideal for PCOS
- Users need **actionable guidance** on how to make dishes PCOS-friendly
- Simply providing nutrition facts doesn't help users manage PCOS symptoms
- Users might avoid healthy traditional dishes thinking they're "bad" when simple modifications can make them PCOS-friendly

---

## Solution

Enhanced the system prompt with **mandatory PCOS-friendly modification guidelines** for ALL nutrition queries.

### New Requirements for LLM

Every nutrition response must now include:

1. **Nutrition Facts** - Macros (calories, protein, carbs, fats, GI)

2. **PCOS Analysis** - Classify the dish:
   - ‚úÖ **PCOS-Friendly**: High protein (>15g), low GI, moderate healthy fats, fiber-rich
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Modification**: High carb, low protein, high refined carbs, fried
   - ‚ùå **Not Recommended**: Very high GI, mostly refined carbs, minimal protein, trans fats

3. **üîÑ PCOS-Friendly Modifications** - MANDATORY section with:
   
   **To Reduce GI & Carbs:**
   - Replace white rice ‚Üí brown rice, quinoa, cauliflower rice
   - Replace wheat flour ‚Üí chickpea flour (besan), almond flour, multigrain atta
   - Replace refined sugar ‚Üí stevia, erythritol, dates (minimal)
   - Add flaxseed/chia seeds for fiber

   **To Boost Protein:**
   - Add paneer, tofu, Greek yogurt
   - Include dal/lentils as side
   - Add boiled egg or roasted chickpeas
   - Mix protein powder into batters

   **To Reduce Unhealthy Fats:**
   - Bake or air-fry instead of deep-frying
   - Use minimal ghee/oil (1-2 tsp max)
   - Replace with olive oil, mustard oil
   - Skip or reduce tempering/tadka

   **Portion Control Tips:**
   - Pair with fiber-rich sides
   - Eat protein first, then carbs
   - Limit portion size
   - Have it earlier in the day

4. **Better Alternatives** - For clearly unhealthy foods, suggest complete replacements

5. **Meal Plan Feature Mention** - Redirect users to personalized meal planning

## Example Enhanced Responses

### Example 1: High-Carb Traditional Dish (Dal Dhokli)

**User Query**: "What are the nutritional breakdown of dal dhokli?"

**Enhanced Response** (what LLM should generate):

```
Dal Dhokli is a nutritious Gujarati dish! Here's the breakdown per serving:

**Nutrition Facts (per 100g):**
- Calories: 330-366
- Protein: 10.5-12.29g
- Carbs: 49.2-52.38g
- Fats: 8.7-14.5g
- GI: Medium-High ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**PCOS Analysis:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Modification
While dal dhokli provides protein from lentils, the refined wheat flour makes it high in carbs and medium-high GI, which can spike blood sugar and insulin.

**üîÑ PCOS-Friendly Modifications:**

**To Reduce GI & Boost Fiber:**
- Replace 50% wheat flour with chickpea flour (besan) or ragi flour
- Add 2 tbsp ground flaxseed to the dough
- Use whole wheat atta instead of refined flour

**To Boost Protein:**
- Increase dal quantity by 50% (more protein, fewer wheat pieces)
- Add 50g crumbled paneer or 1 boiled egg on top
- Serve with Greek yogurt raita (extra protein)

**To Control Portions:**
- Limit to 1 bowl (200g max)
- Eat a side salad first
- Have it for lunch, not dinner
- Add extra vegetables (spinach, fenugreek) for fiber

**Better Alternative:** Try 100% chickpea flour (besan dhokli) + double the dal for higher protein and lower GI!

### Example 2: Fried/Unhealthy Food (Samosa)

**User Query**: "nutritional info on samosa"

**Enhanced Response**:

```
Samosa (per piece, ~100g):
- Calories: 250-300
- Protein: 4-5g (LOW)
- Carbs: 35-40g (HIGH, refined flour)
- Fats: 12-15g (HIGH, deep-fried)
- GI: High ‚≠ê

**PCOS Analysis:** ‚ùå Not Recommended
Samosas are deep-fried in refined oil, made with maida (refined flour), and have minimal protein. This causes rapid blood sugar spikes and inflammation - not ideal for PCOS.

**üîÑ PCOS-Friendly Alternatives:**

**Instead of Samosa, Try:**
1. **Baked Whole Wheat Samosa** - Use whole wheat flour, bake instead of fry, fill with protein-rich moong dal
2. **Paneer Tikka** - High protein, grilled, flavorful
3. **Baked Chickpea Cutlets** - Protein-rich, fiber-loaded, crispy when baked
4. **Air-Fried Veg Kebabs** - Mixed with besan and veggies

**If You Must Have Samosa:**
- Limit to 1 piece (special occasions)
- Bake or air-fry instead of deep fry
- Use whole wheat + chickpea flour mix
- Fill with protein (paneer, sprouted moong)
- Eat with big salad and protein side
- Have it early in the day, not evening

**Better PCOS Snacks:**
- Roasted chickpeas
- Sprouts chaat
- Greek yogurt with nuts
- Boiled egg with veggies
- Paneer cubes with cucumber

### Example 3: Already PCOS-Friendly (Grilled Chicken Salad)

**Enhanced Response**:

```
Grilled Chicken Salad (per serving):
- Calories: 250-300
- Protein: 30-35g (HIGH)
- Carbs: 10-15g (LOW)
- Fats: 10-12g (healthy fats)
- GI: Low ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**PCOS Analysis:** ‚úÖ Excellent Choice!
This is a perfect PCOS-friendly meal - high protein helps stabilize blood sugar, low carbs prevent insulin spikes, and healthy fats support hormone balance.

**‚ú® Optional Enhancements:**

**To Make It Even Better:**
- Add 2 tbsp nuts/seeds (almonds, pumpkin seeds) for extra protein and omega-3s
- Use Greek yogurt-based dressing (adds protein, probiotics)

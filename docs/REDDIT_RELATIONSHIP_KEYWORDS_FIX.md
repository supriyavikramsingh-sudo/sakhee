# Reddit Keyword Extraction Missing Social/Relationship Context - Fix

**Date**: 1 November 2025  
**Issue**: Reddit search not returning relevant threads for relationship/social queries  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## Problem Analysis

### User Report

**Query**: `"Share reddit insights on PCOS related relationship issues"`

**Expected**: Reddit threads about PCOS impact on relationships (e.g., "How PCOS affects my marriage", "Dating with PCOS", "Partner doesn't understand my PCOS")

**Actual**: Generic PCOS threads NOT specifically about relationships:
- "NEED ADVICE FOR PCOS FACIAL HAIR ISSUES AND SUGGESTIONS FOR..."
- "If you could change one thing about PCOS care in India..."
- "PCOS related pain and it's impact on quality of life"
- "a community for pcos peeps to share advice and experiences"
- "An update to blood levels of common deficiencies related to PCOS"

### Root Cause

**File**: `server/src/langchain/chains/chatChain.js`

**Issue**: The keyword extraction in `needsCommunityInsights()` did NOT include relationship/social impact keywords.

**Missing keywords**:
- `relationship`, `relationships`
- `partner`, `husband`, `boyfriend`
- `dating`, `romance`, `intimacy`
- `body image`, `self esteem`, `confidence`
- `social life`, `support`

**Result**: The function extracted only "PCOS" and maybe "issues" as keywords, leading to generic PCOS search results instead of relationship-specific threads.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added New "Social" Category

Added a comprehensive social/relationship impacts category to `pcosKeywordCategories`:

**File**: `server/src/langchain/chains/chatChain.js` (Lines ~952-988)

```javascript
// Social/Relationship impacts
social: [
  'relationship',
  'relationships',
  'partner',
  'husband',
  'boyfriend',
  'dating',
  'romance',
  'intimacy',
  'sex',
  'sexual',
  'libido',
  'marriage',
  'married',
  'spouse',
  'love life',
  'body image',
  'self esteem',
  'confidence',
  'insecure',
  'insecurity',
  'embarrassed',
  'shame',
  'social life',
  'friends',
  'family',
  'work life',
  'career',
  'job',
  'workplace',
  'colleagues',
  'discrimination',
  'stigma',
  'judgment',
  'support',
  'understanding',
  'acceptance',
],
```

**Keywords cover**:
- **Romantic relationships**: partner, dating, romance, intimacy, love life
- **Mental health impacts**: body image, self esteem, confidence, shame
- **Social contexts**: friends, family, work life, colleagues
- **Support needs**: support, understanding, acceptance, stigma

### 2. Added Multi-Word Phrases

Added relationship-specific phrases to `multiWordPhrases` array for higher priority matching:

**File**: `server/src/langchain/chains/chatChain.js` (Lines ~1033-1061)

```javascript
const multiWordPhrases = [
  // ... existing phrases
  'relationship issues',
  'relationship problems',
  'relationship challenges',
  'body image',
  'self esteem',
  'love life',
  'sex life',
];
```

**Priority**: 90 (high priority, higher than most single keywords)

### 3. Updated Priority Scoring

Added 'social' category to the priority assignment with score of 75:

**File**: `server/src/langchain/chains/chatChain.js` (Lines ~1059-1072)

```javascript
priority:
  category === 'core'
    ? 100
    : category === 'symptoms'
    ? 80
    : category === 'social'    // ✅ NEW
    ? 75
    : category === 'geographic'
    ? 70
    : category === 'treatments'
    ? 60
    : category === 'medical'
    ? 50
    : category === 'fertility'
    ? 40
    : 30,
```

**Priority ranking**:
1. Core PCOS terms: 100
2. Phrases (multi-word): 90
3. Symptoms: 80
4. **Social/Relationship: 75** ← NEW
5. Geographic/cultural: 70
6. Treatments: 60
7. Medical markers: 50
8. Fertility: 40

## Performance Impact

**Minimal**: Added ~35 keywords to check, but the function already checks 200+ keywords, so the overhead is negligible (<5ms).

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Expand social keywords**:
   - Add: `communication`, `misunderstanding`, `lonely`, `isolated`
   - Add: `sexual health`, `painful sex`, `dyspareunia`
   - Add: `mental health support`, `therapy`, `counseling`

2. **Cultural context**:
   - Indian relationship terms: `arranged marriage`, `in-laws`, `family pressure`
   - Cultural stigma: `fertility pressure`, `marriage expectations`

3. **Semantic search**:
   - Use embeddings to find relationship threads even without exact keyword matches
   - Detect intent: "My partner doesn't get it" → relationship context

4. **User feedback**:
   - Track when users click Reddit links
   - Learn which keywords lead to most relevant threads
   - Auto-expand keyword lists based on usage patterns

- Body image/self-esteem questions
- Career/work impact discussions
- Social support needs
- Partner communication topics

The fix ensures users get targeted community insights for social and emotional aspects of PCOS, not just medical symptom discussions. 🎉
